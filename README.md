Implimentation of a market making strategy on the FTX cryptocurrency exchange as described in the 2008 paper by Marco Avellaneda and Sasha Stoikov [High-frequency trading in a limit order book](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~avellane/HighFrequencyTrading.pdf).

## Purpose and Design

This implimentation is specifically designed for the ftx exchange using the FIX API and eventually tuned for a specific host machine. 

The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning tool for C++ and low-level architechture.

## Status
This project is currently in the "make it work" stage. Once functional, it will transition to the "make it pretty" stage.
